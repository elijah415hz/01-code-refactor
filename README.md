# 01 Homework assignment: Code Refactor

I have refactored the html and css of this website in order to conform to best practices of accessibilty and readability of code.
This was accomplished primarily by consilidating css selectors and properties, converting generic html tags to semantic tags, adding alt attributes to images, and commenting the code for clarity.

## Assignment from the client:

WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order

```
